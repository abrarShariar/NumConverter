#How it works :

- The application is based on Qt v.5.4. It's built on <em>QDialog</em> class <br>
- The project directory follows the standard Qt project structure. <br>
- The <em>.ui</em> file contains the XML code generating the gui <br>
- *dialog.h* defines the *Dialog* class and its member functins while their implementatin is found at *dialog.cpp* <br>
