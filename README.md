#What is this application :
This is a a small & simple Qt destop application for quick number conversion <br>
Currently the conversions support : <br>
          -Decimal  *(base 10)* <br>
          -Hexadecimal  *(base 16)* <br>
          -Octal  *(base 8)*  <br>
          -Binary   *(base 2)*  <br>
          
#How it works :

- The application is based on Qt v.5.4. It's built on <em>QDialog</em> class <br>
- The project directory follows the standard Qt project structure. <br>
- The <em>.ui</em> file contains the XML code generating the gui <br>
- *dialog.h* defines the *Dialog* class and its member functins while their implementatin is found at *dialog.cpp* <br>
- The *.exec()* function which executes the application is located at *main.cpp* <br>

- Open the file *NumConverter.pro* in Qt Creator and play around with the code !!
